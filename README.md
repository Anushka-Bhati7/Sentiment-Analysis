# Sentiment Analysis Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
# Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform Sentiment Analysis on textual data such as reviews, tweets, or other forms of user-generated content. The goal is to classify the sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral using traditional NLP techniques. This project does not rely on machine learning models but uses techniques like text preprocessing, tokenization, and lexicon-based analysis to extract sentiment.

This analysis helps businesses and organizations understand customer feedback, gauge public opinion, and make informed decisions based on sentiment data.

# Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this analysis contains textual data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or tweets. Each entry represents a unique text item, and the goal is to determine the sentiment associated with it.

Key features include:

   * Review_Text: The raw text of the review or comment.
    
   * Sentiment: The target variable, representing the sentiment of the text (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).
     
The text data is analyzed using NLP techniques to classify it into one of the sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

# Tools and Libraries Used:
  * Language: Python
    
  * Libraries:
     * pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
       
     * nltk: For text preprocessing, tokenization, and sentiment analysis.
       
     * TextBlob: For basic sentiment analysis and text processing.
       
     * matplotlib, seaborn: For data visualization.
       
     * re: For regular expressions (text cleaning).
       
     * wordcloud: For visualizing frequent words and sentiment trends.
# Sentiment Analysis Workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing:

    * Text Cleaning: Remove unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stopwords from the review or post text.
      
    * Tokenization: Break down the text into individual words or tokens for easier analysis.
      
    * Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
      
    * Removing Special Characters: Use regular expressions (re) to remove any unwanted characters like numbers, special characters, or HTML tags.
      
2. Sentiment Classification (Lexicon-based):

* Lexicon-based Approach: Use a predefined lexicon or dictionary of words with associated sentiment scores (e.g., VADER, TextBlob).
  
* VADER Sentiment Analyzer: A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text.
  
* TextBlob: A Python library that assigns polarity (positive or negative sentiment) and subjectivity (subjective or objective) scores to text.
  
* Sentiment Scoring: Each text is assigned a sentiment score:
  
* Positive: If the score is above a certain threshold.
  
* Negative: If the score is below a certain threshold.
  
* Neutral: If the score is close to zero.
  
3. Visualizations:

* Word Cloud: Generate a word cloud to visualize the most common words in positive and negative reviews.
  
* Bar Chart: Show the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) in the dataset.
  
* Sentiment Over Time: Plot how sentiment changes over time (e.g., over months or years).
  
# Expected Outcome:
After applying NLP techniques and using a lexicon-based sentiment analysis method, the goal is to classify each text into one of the three categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The overall outcome is to provide insights into how users feel about a particular product, service, or topic.

# Learning Outcome:
By the end of this project, you'll gain experience with:

* Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and text cleaning.
  
* Using lexicon-based methods like VADER and TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
  
* Visualizing sentiment data through charts and word clouds.
  
* Understanding the importance of NLP techniques for extracting insights from unstructured textual data.
  
# Deliverable:
The final deliverable will be a Jupyter Notebook that includes:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
  
* Sentiment analysis using lexicon-based methods.
  
* Visualizations (e.g., word clouds, sentiment distributions).
  
* Insights and conclusions derived from the sentiment analysis.
